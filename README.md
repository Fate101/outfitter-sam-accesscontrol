# Outfitter - Access Control for SAM

This addon makes it that only people with the Outfitter Permissions using SAM are able to use Outfitter. Users can still select outfits however it will not send it to other players.

**Please note** that players may complain about their POV being laggy when trying to use Outfitter without the required permissions to use it. This is due to the way Outfitter handles "previews" and they'll have to reset Outfitter and not apply an outfit.

## Credits
This is based off of the work done by **LaZycAt.lua** and their version of Access Control on the Workshop. 
Their version supports ULX/Evolve/Exsto. 
Only use this version if you're using the SAM Admin Mod. I have purposely not included ULX etc as the solution already exists.
